## On Doing Less

Recently, I took on the management of the Tech-Leader.

At the same time, I acted as the "lead horse" to solve technical problems that the front-end team encountered.

My goals and to-do are getting bigger and bigger than I can handle them. At the rate I'm going, I probably won't be able to finish my marked of courses in ten years.

As we all know, learning and working can't be treated as the same thing, and being immersed in business prevents you from updating your knowledge and growing.

I tried to change this and Leviwong's article made me wake up.

I will start with the following goals to gradually improve my efficiency and processing of information.

1. focus only on valuable problems that the team cannot solve.
2. complete MIT course challenges
